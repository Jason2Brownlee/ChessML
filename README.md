## About

Participation in the 2010 Kaggle chess rating competition.

> This competition aims to discover whether other approaches can predict the outcome of chess games more accurately than the workhorse Elo rating system.

I believe I came 17th on the private leaderboard.


## Code

A suite of chess rating algorithms were implemented in Java, such as: elo, glicko, chessmetrics, etc.

All of the code seems to have been lost.

A gist of the Glicko algorithm I wrote was captured by the internet archive here:
